							<h3>Kenny Hale (U2X Bono) - Vocals, Guitar</h3>
								
								<p>Kenny Hale is a veteran U2 performer of the highest level and has performed with numerous nationally and internationally touring U2 tribute acts. He is truly a world class vocalist as well as a very accomplished guitarist. His incredible voice and performance of U2's songs would, no doubt, make Bono proud. He's been performing professionally for over 30 years and his most powerful influences were drawn from the rock legends of the 60's, 70's, and 80's, with Bono and U2 being at the top of his list. Kenny's incredible talents give him the ability to passionately deliver a truly memorable performance as Bono and his vocal abilities set him far apart from the rest. Audiences are always amazed by Kenny's voice!
								</p>
							
							<h3>Carl Macchia (U2X Edge) - Guitar, Vocals & Keyboards</h3>
​
								​<p>Carl Macchia has loved U2 from his first listen back in the 80’s and has worked his entire musical life to perfect the sound of the Edge's guitar and his vocals. He studied music theory at UMASS where he played the bar and fraternity circuit and then went on to NYC to do extensive studio and club work. In Southern California, he’s played the Orange County cover band circuit for over 12 years and has also performed all over the US and internationally as the Edge for much of the past 4 years. Often referred to by fans as, “The Good Edge,”he was featured on Mark Cuban’s AXS TV Show, “The World’s Greatest Tribute Bands.” As is the rest of U2X, CJ is the whole package. You’ll be floored by his “magical” guitar sounds, his singing, and his awesome energy.

							<h3>Scott Jones (U2X Adam) - Bass Guitar</h3>
	​
								​<p>Scott is an incredibly talented bass player and musician, and has been playing in U2 tribute bands since 2005. He’s performed over 300 U2 tribute shows across the US, appeared on “The Today Show” and played the official U2 post-concert parties during their “Vertigo Tour”. His performance as Adam Clayton is as good as it gets, from the sound, to the look, to the moves, to the gear. It’s all there. He’s also been lucky enough to personally meet Adam Clayton and prides himself in owning what’s probably the largest collection of U2-specific basses and guitars in the world.
								</p> 

							<h3 id="stevo">Steve Judd Jr. (U2X Larry) - Drums</h3>
	​​
								​<p>Steve is the closest thing to Larry Mullen Jr. on the planet. He not only plays like Larry, but he looks like him and his energy and joy of playing U2 music is amazing to watch. He was featured with Carl on Mark Cuban’s AXS TV Show, “The World’s Greatest Tribute Bands.” A 17-year veteran of the LA music scene, Steve has played with original bands and solo artists at just about every venue in LA and at many others across the US. He’s opened for The Fixx, Erasure, Dramarama, The English Beat, Dave Wakeling, Martha Davis & The Motels and Simple Minds. He’s recorded music for TV, film and commercial placement. Steve has performed countless U2 tribute shows nationally and internationally over the past 4 years, and is thrilled to be paying homage to the man who inspired him to play the drums in the first place.
